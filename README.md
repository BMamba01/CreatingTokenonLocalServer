#Creating token on Local Server

Here in this project we are creating our own token using ERC-20 on `RemixIDE` where we can add functions `mint` ,`burn` and `transfer`.


## How to setup?


Before moving forward, install all required dependencies using the npm install command.

Step 1: Navigate to your project directory using the terminal.
Step 2: Compile the contract using the npx hardhat compile command.
Step 3: Open the localhost network using the npx hardhat node command.
Step 4: In another terminal but in the same directory run the remixd command.
Step 5: Open Remix on your web browser and change the workspace to local host workspace.
Step 6: Compile the contract.
Step 7: Change the Environment to Dev-Hardhat Provider and deploy the smart contract.
By following these steps and installing all necessary dependencies, you'll be able to use this Smart Contract and its functionalities of Minting, Burning, and Transfering tokens.

NOTE- Only the contract owner can mint the tokens to any address
